## 🗃️ Database Design

The database is structured using 3NF principles and includes the following tables:

- `admin`, `agent`, `client`, `owner`  
- `property`, `listing`, `transaction`, `rentaldetails`  

### Key Concepts:

- **One-to-many**: Agent → Properties, Owner → Properties, Client → Transactions  
- **One-to-one**: Property ↔ Listing, Transaction ↔ RentalDetails  

For detailed ERD and table structure, see the `docs/` folder (if applicable).
